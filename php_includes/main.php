    Main Content is here. I wish a double rainbow could be here instead. Why? Because double rainbows mean double
    leprechauns, and double leprechauns mean double pots of gold. Who doesn't want twice as much gold? Think of all
    the chocolate ponies you could buy with that gold. That's right, think about it. Chocolate. Ponies.
